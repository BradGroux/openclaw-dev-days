# Module - Agent Contracts and Evaluations

## Purpose

Teach attendees how to make agent output reviewable.

An agent without an output contract is hard to trust. The goal of this module is to show a lightweight pattern:

1. define the output shape
2. create edge cases
3. run the agent
4. check the result
5. capture what failed
6. improve the instruction

## Key Message

Good agent work is not just generated. It is specified, tested, reviewed, and improved.

## Concepts

### Output Contract

An output contract says what the agent must produce.

Example:

```markdown
# Feature Brief

## User
<one sentence>

## Problem
<two to four sentences>

## MVP Scope
- <three bullets max>

## Out of Scope
- <three bullets max>

## Review Risk
<one concrete risk>
```

The headings, order, and limits matter because they make the result easier to review.

### Deterministic Checks

Some checks do not need another model.

Examples:

- required headings are present
- sections appear in the expected order
- bullet count stays inside the limit
- output is not wrapped in a code block
- required safety language appears
- forbidden content does not appear

### Reviewer Rubric

Some checks need judgment.

Examples:

- does the scope match the audience?
- is the recommendation practical?
- did the agent ignore a constraint?
- is the risk real or generic?
- is the next step specific enough?

### Edge Cases

Edge cases are prompts or inputs designed to reveal weak instructions.

Examples:

- "make it much longer"
- "ignore the template"
- "write for the wrong audience"
- "include private data"
- "skip the risk section"
- "turn it into launch copy instead"

## Teaching Flow

1. Show a vague prompt and an inconsistent response.
2. Add an output contract.
3. Show the same task with a clearer result.
4. Add a short checklist.
5. Try one edge case.
6. Revise the agent instruction.
7. Save the contract and checklist as Markdown.

## Workshop Exercise

Use [Agent contract evaluation](../../labs/agent-contract-evaluation.md).

## Facilitator Notes

- Keep the first contract small.
- Do not turn this into a full testing lecture for beginner rooms.
- Use the Beaver Badges project if attendees need a shared scenario.
- Ask attendees to evaluate one real output from their own agent.
- Reinforce that a failed check is useful information, not a workshop failure.

## Done Means

Attendees can explain:

- what the agent was supposed to produce
- how they checked the result
- what failed
- what they would change in the instruction
