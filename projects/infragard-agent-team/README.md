# InfraGard Agent Team Project

This project is the **hands-on takeaway** from the InfraGard AI Agent Workshop on May 14, 2026.

Instead of building a consumer app, this project teaches attendees how to define a practical AI agent team for critical infrastructure, security, operations, or business-process work.

By the end of the workshop, you'll have a template you can apply to **any process** in your work: SOP improvement, log analysis, incident response, field data automation, or operational coordination.

The session is conceptual and workflow-focused; this project is your personal learning lab afterward.

## Goal

Create a small, safe, useful agent team around one real, low-risk process from your work.

## Recommended Agent Team

Start with four core roles:

1. **Process Mapper** — turns messy workflows into clear steps, decisions, inputs, outputs, and owners.
2. **Security Reviewer** — identifies data, credential, operational, and compliance risks.
3. **Documentation Writer** — creates SOPs, checklists, runbooks, and briefing notes.
4. **Implementation Planner** — turns recommendations into next steps, tasks, verification gates, and follow-up actions.

Optional fifth role:

5. **Automation Scout** — suggests low-risk automation opportunities, integrations, monitoring, or scripts.

## Starter Exercise

Use [`memory-template.md`](memory-template.md) as your starting point, or create a file called `memory.md` in this folder with:

```markdown
# My InfraGard Agent Team

## Process

Describe one real process from work that I want to improve.

What is it? Who does it? How long does it take? What's broken or inefficient?

## Constraints

What data or systems are involved? What sensitive information is at risk? What approvals are needed?

### Implementation Planner

### Automation Scout (optional)
[Your prompts or instructions for this role]

## First Output

What is the first thing I want this team to produce? 
- A flowchart of the workflow?
- A risk/guardrail checklist?
- A draft SOP or runbook?
- An implementation plan?
- A list of automation opportunities?
```

## Success Criteria

By the end, you should have:

- One documented workflow (what's the process?)
- One agent team design (who are the roles? what do they do?)
- One risk/guardrail checklist (what can go wrong? what should be protected?)
- One draft SOP, checklist, runbook, or implementation plan (the first output)
- One next action you can safely take after the workshop

## Security Rule

Use low-risk or sanitized examples while learning. 

**Do not:**
- Paste secrets, credentials, API keys, or tokens
- Include customer names, contract details, or regulated data
- Expose IP addresses, network topology, or unpatched vulnerabilities
- Use real health data, HIPAA-regulated info, or proprietary formulas

**Do:**
- Use mock/example data
- Describe the process in general terms
- Focus on the workflow and structure
- Verify output before using it in production

## Real-World Examples from the Workshop

### Heavy Haul Trucking

A 35-year-old company that quadrupled in size serving data center builds. They needed real-time load tracking for AWS contracts. An agent team helped them move from spreadsheets and emails to automated tracking in weeks instead of months.

**Lessons:**
- Small teams can compete with large operations if they think automation-first.
- Real-time data beats periodic manual updates.
- Trust the agents, but verify the output.

### Oilfield Water Testing

An 80-person company generating $100M/year in oilfield water testing and chemical manufacturing. They had tons of well-site data but were still using spreadsheets, emails, and WhatsApp for field reporting.

An agent team helped them:
- Automate field sample photo → lab report
- Build a customer portal instead of manual data sharing
- Speed up turnaround from days to hours

**Lessons:**
- Institutional knowledge is an asset; automation unlocks it.
- Proving value in one process opens doors for many.
- Iteration and feedback loops matter.

## Next Steps After the Workshop

1. **Build your `memory.md` file** with your process and agent roles.
2. **Test with one agent** (Process Mapper or your coding assistant) on your process.
3. **Iterate** — output will likely not be perfect. That's expected.
4. **Verify** — review the agent's work for accuracy and safety.
5. **Share** — bring results back to the community Discord or a follow-up session.
6. **Scale** — once you've proven the approach on one process, apply it to others.
